tool to mount dfs on linux,tool to mount ndfs on linux
Datanode corruption,hadoop nameserver does not recognise ndfs nameserver image
MapRed tries to allocate tasks to nodes that have no available disk space,The task tracker should track disk space used; and have a configurable cap
Files missing chunks can cause mapred runs to get stuck,infinite retries accessing a missing block
Create a job-configurable best effort for job execution,
include records/second and bytes/second in  task reports,Standard set of Performance Metrics for Hadoop
mapred input and output dirs must be absolute,
MapReduce log files should be storable in dfs.,

DataNode should be capable of managing multiple volumes,hash blocks into dfs.data.dirs
DataNode should be capable of managing multiple volumes,starting one data node thread to manage multiple data directories
Implement speculative re-execution of reduces,we need speculative execution for reduces
disallow more than one datanode running on one computing sharing the same data directory,don't permit two datanodes to run from same dfs.data.dir
task trackers can only be assigned one task every heartbeat,tasktracker waits for 10 seconds for asking for a task.
Reflexive access to non-public class with public ctor requires setAccessible (with some JVMs),Static blocks do not automatically run when a class is loaded in Java 5.0
DFS commands either do not support some popular unix commands or have inconsistent behaviors,
"Should be able to specify ""wide"" or ""full"" replication",need standard API to set dfs replication = high
Overlong UTF8's not handled well,class Text (replacement for class UTF8) was: HADOOP-136
potential conflict in block id's; leading to data corruption,dfs should allocate a random blockid range to a file; then assign ids sequentially to blocks in the file
Add a conf dir parameter to the scripts,the start up scripts should take a command line parameter --config making it easy to run multiple hadoop installation on same machines
dfs should allocate a random blockid range to a file; then assign ids sequentially to blocks in the file,
task trackers should not restart for having a late heartbeat,JobTracker dumps TaskTrackers if it takes too long to service an RPC call
tasks are left over when a job fails,very long cleanup after a job fails
Namespace check pointing is not performed until the namenode restarts.,Redesign the dfs namespace datastructures to be copy on write
Add a interactive shell for admistrative access to the DFS,
Speed up SequenceFile sort with memory reduction,
jobs don't get executed in parallel,maps from second jobs will not run until the first job finishes completely
Should be able to specify more than one jar into a JobConf file,
should allow to specify different inputformat classes for different input dirs for Map/Reduce jobs,
native support for gzipped text files,
MiniMapReduce tests get stuck because of some timing issues with initialization of tasktrackers.,
chukwa agent controller remove file does not work ,
Chukwa log4j appender logs corrupted data if the system is under high stress,Hadoop Metrics Log file should be used by only one process
chukwa metrics file get overwritten when process launch,Chukwa Log4JMetricsContext class should append new log to current log file
FileSystem#copyToLocalFile shouldn't copy .crc files,
Add md5sum facility in dfsshell,
NPE when the namenode comes up but the filesystem is set to file://,
BZip2CompressionOutputStream sometimes corrupts data,bzip2 codec (CBZip2OutputStream) creates corrupted output file for some inputs
UserGroupInformation prints out excessive ERROR warnings,Lower the logging level from ERROR to WARN for UGI.doAs method
RetryInvocationHandler should recognise that there is no point retrying to auth failures,
TestMetricsSystemImpl#testInitFirstVerifyStopInvokedImmediately fails on trunk,TestMetricsSystemImpl#testInitFirstVerifyStopInvokedImmediately failed
race condition in MetricsSystemImpl#publishMetricsNow that causes incorrect results,TestMetricsSystemImpl#testMultiThreadedPublish occasionally fails
